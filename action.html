                    The issue of the effects of alcohol on the developing brain will not de-escalate, however, the causes of it will. Young people are drinking less and less and though the effects of underage drinking remain the same, the amount of people that suffer through it will decrease drastically. It's like if 20% of 12 to 17 year-olds in 2010 drank alcohol, and that number reduced to 10% in 2020, then that 10% will still suffer the consequences, but now it's only 10% and not 20%. A study done by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre in Australia states that ‚Äúthe proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds who reported any drinking in the past year halved from 35% in 2004 to 18% in 2013,‚Äù and ‚Äúover the same period, drinking by 16- to 17-year-olds fell sharply from 81% to 59%.‚Äù So although the issue will still be present it will be significantly less prominent as there will be fewer people for it to affect.

                    The best advice you can give to anyone suffering from the consequences of underage drinking is to stop drinking. This may seem rather obvious but if they don‚Äôt do this one thing then there is no way that they will recover. It‚Äôs equivalent to telling a phone-addicted teen to stop using their phone because that‚Äôs the only thing that they can do. The real question is, how are you going to stop using your phone? My answer to this is to do something else, something beneficial, something productive, but most of all something enjoyable. The best way to stop bad habits and start new, good ones is by filling your life with purpose. Using that time you would‚Äôve spent drinking to learn a new skill, or to play a sport. So in summary, to stop the effects of underage drinking, we have to stop underage drinking altogether, and that is done by filling your life with peace and purpose.

                    What safe drug & alcohol strategies can you suggest to enhance the safety and wellbeing of yourself and others?

                    Safe drug and alcohol strategies to enhance the safety and well-being of yourself and others are few and far between, but there are some of note. The most obvious is drinking in controlled amounts and such that you are not too intoxicated, but another is to be with friends and people you trust when you do choose to drink. Being at a club or bar by yourself with no one you know is much less safe than being with people you know and trust. This is because they can help you when you are under the influence and assist you with certain tasks such as driving. Therefore, some strategies to maximise the health and safety of yourself and others in drug and alcohol-related situations are drinking in controlled portions if you do drink and having somebody you know and trust with you.
