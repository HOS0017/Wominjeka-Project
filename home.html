                    Numerous studies conducted over several decades have demonstrated the negative consequences of persistent excessive drinking on the central nervous system as well as some of the mechanisms underlying these effects. Given how widespread heavy drinking is among youth, questions about how alcohol affects brain development and function during adolescence are particularly important. In one survey, for instance, 36% of respondents who were between the ages of 19 and 28 said they had had five or more drinks in a row during the two weeks prior.

Additionally, they discovered that teenagers with alcohol dependence who reported experiencing more alcohol withdrawal symptoms also had worse visuospatial performance.
