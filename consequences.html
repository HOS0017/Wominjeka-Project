                    Social issues include fighting and disengagement from youth activities. In fact, compared to nondrinkers, heavy drinkers were more likely to report feeling hopeless or depressed. Legal issues include being arrested for driving while intoxicated or for causing bodily harm to someone. Additionally, giving alcohol to a minor under the age of eighteen is against the law unless it is done on private property, and the parent or legal guardian of the adolescent must provide authorisation for the teenager to receive alcohol.

                    <span class="traffic-related">Among individuals aged 16 to 20, drivers, passengers, or pedestrians who had consumed alcohol were involved in 39% of road deaths. 1,884 drivers under the age of 21 had positive blood alcohol levels in fatal motor vehicle incidents. 1,099 people, excluding intoxicated drivers under the age of 21, perished in deadly collisions involving such drivers in 2001. According to a more recent nationwide investigation, with a blood alcohol level of 0.08%, there was at least an 11-fold greater probability of single-vehicle fatal crash involvement across all age and gender groups. On the other hand, the chance of a single-vehicle fatal crash increased 52 times for male drivers between the ages of 16 and 20.</span> <span class="general">In comparison to abstainers, a higher proportion of drinkers, particularly heavy drinkers on a regular basis, carried weapons, used physical force, experienced depression or hopelessness, tried suicide, used other psychoactive drugs, had sex earlier in life, had more partners, were more likely to have unprotected sex, and were more likely to have gotten someone pregnant.</span> <span class="drug-related">In comparison to individuals who abstained from alcohol, frequent heavy drinkers exhibited higher rates of using tobacco products, such as cigarettes (94% versus 46%), snuff (32% versus 2%), and cigars (51% versus 4%). Furthermore, they were significantly more likely in the previous 30 days to have engaged in the use of marijuana (73% versus 7%), cocaine (26% versus 0%), glue inhalation (32% versus 2%), heroin (15% versus less than 1%), methamphetamines (37% versus 2%), steroids (18% versus 2%), and illegal injected drugs (13% versus less than 1%). Lastly, findings from the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicate that individuals who never consumed alcohol were more inclined to report predominantly receiving A grades (29%) in contrast to those who drank but never exceeded 5 drinks at a time (21%) or those who drank 5 or more drinks on at least 6 occasions in the past month (12%).</span>
